## FibreNet project documentation


### 1. About this repository

This repository contains general-purpose particle dynamics simulation code. Its
main application is the simulation of meso-scale mechanics of fiber networks.

Basic capabilities:
* simulation of non-bonded interactions (penalty spring model used to minimize interpenetration
between the surfaces in contact, Lennard-Jones potentials, harmonic potentials)
* grid based collision detection
* simulation of fibre mechanics - axial and bending stiffness described by means of harmonic bond
and angle potentials
* integration based on modified Velocit-Verlet algorith
* periodic boundary conditions or finite simulation box

When executed code requires an input text file to run the simulations. The input text file contains informations about types of structures used, basic simulation settings, such as size of simulation box, time step, exported data types, definitions of non-bonded interactions etc.. The input file contains also path to model file. Model file is written in plain text format. Model file contains information regarding basic data structures used by simulation software - particles/beads - their initial positions, properties, connectivity.

Presented software is siutable for execution on both GPUs and CPUs. The code architecture was optimized to perform computations using GPUs, while CPU unit manages the host code. This was achieved by including the OpenCL open-source library (Khronos Group, USA). The project was written using the Microsoft Visual Studio Version 16.4.0 (Microsoft Corporation, USA). The host code was written using C++ programming language. It is responsible for managing all OpenCL instructions (managing the data buffers, compiling kernels etc.), reading input files, reading model files, writing all output data, uploading kernels. In the current version of the project all OpenCL kernels are storred in a text file "kernel.cl". This file contains all the necessary definitions of sturctures and functions to perform particle dynamics simulations. The presence of the kernel.cl file in the same directory as the executable is required to run the compiled code.
>Warning
There are no guaranties that this software will run on your machine.   



### 2. Model file format

Model file contains information regarding basic data structures used by simulation software. Model file is written in plain text format. Each line of the text define one structure. Each line begins with *keyword*, which defines the type of data structure. *Keyword* is followed by set of *parameters* describing a given structure. A **tab** sign is used as a delimiter for *keywords* and *parameters*.

Basic data structures are:
* BEADS / PARTICLES
* SPRINGS
* ANGULAR BONDS

Please note the numbering of all structures in the model file begins with zero.

### 4. Simulation output files

Currently simulation software exports all data into *.XYZ file format. The XYZ file is a chemical file format. XYZ format specifies the molecule geometry by giving the number of atoms with Cartesian coordinates that will be read on the first line, a comment on the second, and the lines of atomic coordinates in the following lines. The file format is used in computational chemistry programs for importing and exporting geometries. For each exported data type a separte output file is created.

The general standard of XYZ file used by this software is as follows:
```text
[number_of_beads_in_frame]
FRAME [simulation_step] [time_step] [box_size_x] [box_size_y] [box_size_z]
[bead_type] [X] [Y] [Z]
[bead_type] [X] [Y] [Z]
[bead_type] [X] [Y] [Z]
```

Example of output file contents:

```text
260771
FRAME	0	0.00010	111.00000	41.00000	192.00000
C1	62.43267	38.48528	74.04371
C1	62.92883	38.53411	74.00564
C1	63.42559	38.58228	73.97371
C1	63.92228	38.62974	73.94312
C1	64.41902	38.67600	73.91435
C1	64.91684	38.71324	73.88955
C1	65.41514	38.74277	73.86693
C1	65.91435	38.75716	73.84760
C1	66.41398	38.75830	73.83040
C1	66.91309	38.73811	73.81577
C1	67.41132	38.69516	73.80389
```


Software allows to save intermediate or final simulation data, required to restart the simulation from the last completed step. The restart file is written as plain text file with *.res extension. The general standard of restart file used by this software is similar to XYZ file format, however it contains additional data fields (positions, velocities, forces and absolute positions of beads):

```text
[number_of_beads_in_frame]
FRAME [simulation_step] [time_step] [box_size_x] [box_size_y] [box_size_z]
[bead_type] [X] [Y] [Z] [VX] [VY] [VZ] [FX] [FY] [FZ] [IX] [IY] [IZ]

### 5. Running the code
Before running the code, it is necessary to prepare the simulation input data
file and the model file. These files should be placed in the same directory as
the code executable file. The "kernel.cl" file with the device code must also be
located in the same directory.

The input file must have all the necessary definitions of simulation conditions,
as well as data types and output file names. After running the code, the user will
be asked to select one of the available OpenCL platforms, from a list of those
available on the device. Selection is made by typing the number of the platform
from the list and confirming the selection with the enter key. The user is then
asked to select one of the devices available on the chosen platform. Finally,
the user is prompted to specify the name of the batch file by typing its name
along with the file extension and confirming with the enter key.
